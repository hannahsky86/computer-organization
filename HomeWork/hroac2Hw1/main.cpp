Problem 2a: (8 points Write a C++ program that inputs the length and width of two rectangles (in
integers) representing a house and a garage. Write a function that uses Call-by-Value
int rectArea (int len, int wid) that returns the area of a rectangle with length len and width wid. Divide
the area of the garage by the area of the house and multiply by 100 to determine the percentage (int).
Enter your name as a Global variable and all other variables should be local variables in main or
rectArea.

Problem 2b: (7 points) Draw the memory and run-time stack when rectArea is called. This should look
similar to Fig 2.17g in the textbook and ALL of your variable names should be shown including name.
Remember, local variables are stored on the stack and global variables are stored in fixed memory. You
may hand draw & scan or use Paint or Visio or Googledraw, etc to create this and paste into your
